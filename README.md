## Short Description
The game is written in pygame and all the required spirits for the game are contained in the above directory. I trained a CNN on Rock,Paper, Scissors dataset and it is used to detect the gestures and based on the gestures detected the game is programmed to perform either Left, Right or Fire for Rock, Paper and Scissors respectively.

If you want to run the code please run HandGesture_Spaceinvaders.py
